<h1>PJATK - MIW PROJECTS</h1>

This is a set of projects that I made during the **MIW** classes at **PJATK**

Most of them are using neural networks made using python and jupiter. Some projects will be explained more thoroughy in a seperate README file contained within their respective directories

<i>btw some of the tasks in jupiter files might be in polish, I might translate it someday, but for now I'll just throw you in at the deepl end<i>
