Write a program that learns the game "rock, paper, scissors". Use a Markov chain with a transition matrix between three states (rock, paper, scissors) as the learning algorithm. Learning the game involves correcting the transition matrix (conditional probabilities of state change), payoff value: 1 in the case of a win, -1 in the case of a loss and 0 in the case of a draw, carry out a sequence of dozen games. Plot a graph of how the cash balance changes at each step of the game.
